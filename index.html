      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="aboutme1">
        My love for computer science originally stemmed from my childhood
        passion for video games and from there it flourished into a love for the
        subject as a whole. My goal is to gain experience in the computer
        science field and use the knowledge I gain as a means to create helpful
        and efficient tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
      <p id="academics">
        I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Maryland - College Park,
        studying Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity. While doing general education courses, I
        discovered that I am also interested in learning how people think, and
        why they think the way they do, so I am also taking upper (300/400)
        level classes in psychology. Over the past 3+ years, I have had the
        great privilege of working with serveral different programming
        languages. For example, functional languages, such as OCAML, Dafny, and
        Haskell, and imperative languages, such as Java, C, Python, and even
        some AVR assembly.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p id="academics2">
        The rigorous program at UMD has introduced and given me the opportunity
        to explore numerous topics such as,
        <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>,
        <strong>memory allocation</strong>, <strong>compilers</strong>,
        <strong>garbage collection</strong>, <strong>algorithms</strong>,
        <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>databases/queries</strong>,
        and <strong>machine learning</strong> to name a few.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Passions</h2>
      <p id="passions">
        Aside from computer science, my passion for video games is still very
        alive and I enjoy playing games such as Apex Legends, Monster Hunter,
        and Marvel Rivals. Some other interests of mine include spending time
        with friends, music, sewing/fashion, art, and traveling/sightseeing.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><u>Mini Shell</u></strong>
        </li>
        Used
        <strong>C</strong>
        to build a mini-shell that could handle commands and supported boolean
        (using pipes, I/O redirection, exec, threads/processes).

        <li>
          <strong><u>Functional Compiler</u></strong>
        </li>
        I used
        <strong>OCaml</strong
        >, to implement all three stages of a working compiler; a lexer, a
        parser, and an evaluator.
        <br />Implemented a (Mini-Dafny) compiler using
        <strong>Haskell</strong>
        that used verification conditions for improved functionality.

        <li>
          <strong><u>Machine Learning</u></strong>
        </li>
        Trained a ML model using data from PlanetTerp that could predict a
        professors rating based on reviews (sentiment level), department, and
        course level. 3 models that used
        <strong>linear regression, KNN, and decision trees</strong
        >.

        <li>
          <strong><u>Web Development (Frontend & Backend)</u></strong>
        </li>
        Created functional websites using
        <strong>HTML/CSS</strong
        >. These websites contained forms and were able to get and post data.
        Used
        <strong>XAMPP</strong
        >.
        <br />Used
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>
        to make a functional Photo Viewer that displayed photos continuously in
        a random order and could read user uploaded photos. Created an Event
        Planner using
        <strong>Node.js</strong>
        and
        <strong>Express</strong>
        that relied on databases like
        <strong>MongoDB</strong>
        to store and remove events. This stored the weather on the day of the
        event and was linked to a person object (JSON notation).

        <li>
          <strong><u>Data Structures</u></strong>
        </li>
        Used
        <strong>Java</strong>
        to create an original data structure that was similar to a set but could
        also store duplicates. Constructed functional data structures from
        scratch (Linked List, HashSet, Binary Search Tree). Wrote iterators for
        all.
